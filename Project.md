<p>The system provides more features to help users communicate easier, by focusing on the friend networking by ID. Therefore, every user can go through his own group (group ID) or chat with others. One is able to update his own status or upload media files, or track his friend’s position.</p>
<h2>System description</h2>
<p>This system is targeted to Metropolia students and teachers, in order to create a convenient and dynamic communication environment.</p>
<p>The system will be built on 2 main sides:
<ul>
<li>The front-end: the layout, user interface where the users interact with the app.</li>
<li>The back-end: where the server will receive and process data from the users.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>For deployment, the core code of application is stored on univerisity server and users can access to application as a web application.</p>

<h1>Use cases</h1>
<h2>User group overview</h2>
